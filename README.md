There are two subfolders under the main directory. The "image" folder contains 10 hyperspectral images, each with 32 spectral bands, a size of 512 Ã— 512 pixels, and depicting 7 types of objects. The naming format is 201912_n.tif, where n ranges from 1 to 10.

The "labels" folder contains the labels for the ten images in the "images" folder, with the same naming format of 201912_n.tif, where n also ranges from 1 to 10. Each label has values ranging from 0 to 7, and the category represented by each value can be found in sample_proportion.png.

201912_n.png, where n ranges from 1 to 10, represents the bar chart distribution of each category in 201912_n.tif.

201912_n_color.png, where n ranges from 1 to 10, represents the visualized pseudocolor map of the labels in 201912_n.tif.
